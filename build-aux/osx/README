This document briefly describes how to build and package bedit for OS X.

Building bedit for OS X
=============================================================================
Please see build/README for more details on building bedit


Making a bedit bundle
=============================================================================

You can make a bedit bundle (i.e. a bedit.app) with a script provided by
bedit.

    ./make bundle

Note that in order for this to succeed, you will need to have built bedit
successfully before. If successful, you will now have a bedit.app bundle
in this directory. Similarly, if you want to build the final dmg image,
you can use:

    ./make dmg

Again, for this to succeed you first need to have successfully built the
bundle.
