gedit development - getting started
===================================

The following explanations can be improved over time, if you see something
missing, a feedback is welcome.

Programming languages and paradigms
-----------------------------------

gedit is mostly written in C, with some plugins in Python or
[Vala](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/Vala/). The build system is in
[Meson](https://mesonbuild.com/).

The code is object-oriented and event-driven. In C, it's thanks to the use of
the GObject library (see next section). If you open some `*.c` or `*.h` files,
you may think “what is this horror?!” but – don't panic – it's just some
C/GObject boilerplate code, and that boilerplate can be generated by a tool. So
once you've learned GObject, you will no longer be afraid ;-)

Libraries used
--------------

As every GNOME application, gedit uses the GLib, GObject and GTK libraries. To
modify the gedit source code, you should be familiar with those libraries. See
the [GTK website](https://www.gtk.org/) and the document
[The GLib/GTK Development Platform – A Getting Started Guide](https://people.gnome.org/~swilmet/glib-gtk-book/).

The main widget used by gedit is GtkTextView, a general-purpose multiline text
editor. To learn that widget API, read the excellent
[GtkTextView tutorial](http://www.bravegnu.org/gtktext/) (a bit old but still
mostly valid). But GtkTextView is not enough for source code edition. gedit
actually uses the
[GtkSourceView](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/GtkSourceView) library, which
contains a subclass of GtkTextView with syntax highlighting, a completion
framework, the search and replace, and many other features useful for a text
editor or an IDE.

For its plugin system, gedit uses the
[libpeas](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/Libpeas) library.

Plugins may have other dependencies, for example the spell-checking plugin uses
[gspell](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/gspell).

gedit architecture
------------------

The [gedit Git repository](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gedit) contains the
_gedit core_ plus the default plugins. There is also the
[gedit-plugins Git repository](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gedit-plugins)
for additional official plugins. The gedit core source code is in the `gedit/`
directory. The plugins are in … `plugins/`!

gedit core provides:
- A basic text editor.
- The integration of libpeas, with an API for plugins.

There is a class diagram of gedit core in the file
[class-diagram.dia](class-diagram.dia) (but it may be outdated, see the Git log
for that file).

Build/Installation
------------------

See the file [build.md](build.md).

First contribution
------------------

See the [Newcomers](https://wiki.gnome.org/Newcomers/) page to start
contributing to GNOME in general.

To know how to contribute to gedit specifically, read the
[README.md](../README.md) and [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) files
present in the Git repository (and then you'll see that the `CONTRIBUTING.md`
file refers to this file, but please don't end up in an infinite reading loop).

To find something interesting to do, […]. TODO: provide list of easy tasks in
gedit itself.

A good way to learn a lot of things is to write a new plugin (as a third-party
plugin first). To have some inspiration, see the wiki page
[RequestedPlugins](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Bedit/RequestedPlugins).

A potentially easy task (but not always) is to fix compilation warnings, for
example when a deprecated function is used. If you encounter a runtime warning
or critical message, it is also a good idea to fix it.

Improvements to the documentation (for users or developers) or the wiki is also
useful.

Happy hacking!\
